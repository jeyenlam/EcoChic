<h2>Inspiration</h2>
Our inspiration stems from the recognition that sustainable fashion often remains under-discussed in minority groups and non-English-speaking communities. Identifying this gap, we aimed to create a platform where user experience takes precedence, ensuring accessibility for everyone, regardless of their knowledge level in sustainable fashion or digital literacy.


<h2>What it does</h2>
Discover an aesthetically pleasing hub showcasing vetted sustainable brands. Tailor your experience by selecting your preferred language, making sustainable fashion accessible to a global audience. Seamlessly explore our platform with intuitive sorting and filtering options. Delve deeper into each brand's story, item categories such as fashion and makeup, and user reviews on their personalized formatted pages. As a unique feature, our interactive map beckons users to embark on a global exploration, pinpointing sustainable brands in their local vicinity or across the world.
